        "Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",

        "### What is __del__ in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "### Why is it significant?\n",
        "\n",
        "The __del__ method is useful for resource cleanup. For example:\n",

        "a. Closing file connections\n",

        "\n",
        "### Important Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "a. Python has automatic garbage collection, so you don't usually need to worry about freeing memory.\n",

        "**Ans** - We often deal with large datasets, multiple variables, and loops. If I don’t manage memory properly, my Python programs can become slow, crash, or consume too much RAM. That’s why memory management is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is Memory Management?\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory management is the process of:\n",

        "### Why Memory Management is Important in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Prevents Program Crashes\n",
        "\n",
        "If memory is used carelessly (e.g., loading large files without releasing memory), programs may crash or freeze. Proper memory handling keeps programs stable.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Improves Performance\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficient memory usage results in faster code execution. This is especially important in data analysis when performing operations on large DataFrames or NumPy arrays.\n",

        "3. Reduces Memory Waste\n",

        "\n",
        "Garbage collection is the process of automatically freeing up memory by deleting objects that are no longer used in the program.\n",

        "2. Garbage Collector (GC) for handling cyclic references\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Reference Counting\n",
        "\n",
        "- Every object in Python has a reference count (i.e., how many variables point to it).\n",
        "\n",
        "- When an object’s reference count becomes zero, it means nothing is using it, so Python deletes it.\n",

        "**Ans**- When working with files in Python, it's important to close them properly after use. Failing to do so can lead to data loss, memory leaks, or program errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Does Closing a File Mean?\n",
        "When we open a file in Python using open(), it uses system resources like memory and file handles. The close() function tells Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Stop accessing the file\n",
        "\n",
        "- Release the system resources\n",

        "Reason-----------------------|---------------\tExplanation\n",

        "b. Data Integrity-----------------------|---------------\t\tWhen writing to a file, close() ensures all data is saved (flushed).\n",
        "\n",
        "c. Avoiding File Corruption-----------------------|---------------\t\tFiles not closed properly may get corrupted or have incomplete content.\n",
        "\n",
        "d. Limiting Open File Count-----------------------|---------------\t\tOperating systems have a limit on the number of files you can open.\n",

        "e. Better Code Management-----------------------|---------------\t\tClosed files reduce bugs in larger applications or data pipelines.\n",
